This YAML file is the output of the truffleHog scan against the `castle.cms` repository, which was transformed from JSON to YAML in your `entrypoint.sh` script. 

Each entry in the YAML file is a potential secret found by truffleHog. The entries are divided by "---", and the information in each entry is:

- **SourceMetadata**: This includes data about the git commit where the potential secret was found, including the commit hash, file, author email, repository, timestamp, and line number.
- **SourceID, SourceType, SourceName**: These provide information about the source of the data, which in this case is truffleHog scanning a git repository.
- **DetectorType, DetectorName, DecoderName**: These provide information about how the potential secret was detected and decoded. The DetectorType is "URI", indicating that the secret was found in a URL, and the DecoderName is either "PLAIN" or "BASE64", indicating the decoding method used.
- **Verified**: This is false, indicating that the potential secret has not been verified as a true secret.
- **Raw, RawV2**: These are the raw strings found that are suspected to be secrets. In this case, they are URLs with a username and password embedded.
- **Redacted**: This is the redacted version of the potential secret, with the password replaced by asterisks.
- **ExtraData, StructuredData**: These fields are null, but could contain additional information about the potential secret.

The entries in the YAML file suggest that truffleHog found a URL with a username and password embedded in the `castle.cms` repository. It appears to have found the same secret twice, once with plain decoding and once with base64 decoding. It's also worth noting that the URL is a placeholder (http://username:password@host.com:80), so it may not represent a real security issue unless real credentials were used in place of the placeholders.
